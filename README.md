**_Description_**

**Aquatic Chords** is a simple synthesizer app that lets users play with the chords of the song "Aquatic Ambience" from Donkey Kong Country, composed by David Wise. 

Built with Tone.js and React, the instrument is a polyphonic AM synthesizer run through reverb and delay effects.

Plans for future updates include better mobile compatibility for sound and interactive effects knobs.
